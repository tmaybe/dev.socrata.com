### Learn How to Retrieve Data from&nbsp;APIs and Socrata Datasets

Join Chris Metcalf, Socrata Director of Developer Experience, as he first looks at how to discover open data APIs. Once a useful API is discovered, he then shows the basics of retrieving data through an API. This includes how to explore a Socrata dataset. If you need additional help, Chris also introduces the [Socrata Developer Site](http://dev.socrata.com/) where you can find help documents and additional how-to information.
