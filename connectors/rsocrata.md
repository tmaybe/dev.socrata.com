[RSocrata](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata) is a free and open source package that is listed in CRAN for the data science language R.  The City of Chicago has been using this on the consumption side for a number of years and helped to write the initial package.  Now there is also a method for the RSocrata that allows publishing to datasets as well.  This opens up a new side of using R as an ETL framework for publishing data to Socrata Open Data Portals   

Lots of companies and the community have created extensions into R for their solutions including [Oracle](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROracle/index.html),[MySQL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html), and [Salesforce](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RForcecom/) to just name a few.
