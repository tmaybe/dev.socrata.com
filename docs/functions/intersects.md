{% include function_header.html %}

The `intersects(...)` function is most commonly used in the `$where` parameter or `WHERE` clause as a filter for {% include dt.html dt="Point" %}, {% include dt.html dt="Line" %}, and {% include dt.html dt="Polygon" %} fields, to identify records that intersect or overlap with another. It accepts two parameters:

- The field name of a {% include dt.html dt="Point" %}, {% include dt.html dt="Line" %}, and {% include dt.html dt="Polygon" %}
- A {% include dt.html dt="Point" %}, {% include dt.html dt="Line" %}, or {% include dt.html dt="Polygon" %} in [WKT (Well-Known Text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) format

[WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) is a standard way of encoding geospatial data in a textual manner, and is more compact than GeoJSON. For example, a Point would be encoded as:

    POINT (-87.637714 41.887275)
    
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p><em>Heads up!</em> Contrary to the normal convention of "latitude, longitude" ordering in the <code>coordinates</code> property, Well-known text orders the coordinates as "longitude, latitude" (X coordinate, Y coordinate), as other GIS coordiate systems are encoded.</p>
</div>

The `intersects(...)` method is frequently used to identify what Polygon a given point is within. For example, the below query will identify what park a given point is within:

{% include tryit.html domain='data.seattle.gov' path='/resource/n99g-k8uj.json' args="$where=intersects(the_geom, 'POINT (-122.4218242 47.662893)')" %}

It's also useful for intersecting polygons with other polygons. For example, the following will return all of the parks that intersect with an arbitrary triangle in North Seattle:

{% include tryit.html domain='data.seattle.gov' path='/resource/n99g-k8uj.json' args="$where=intersects(the_geom, 'POLYGON((-122.34649658203125 47.70171863436363,-122.39524841308594 47.6559500873343,-122.29568481445312 47.6559500873343,-122.34649658203125 47.70171863436363))')" %}
