{% include function_header.html %}

The `count(...)` function is most commonly used in `$select` aggregations to return the count of a set of values. For example, to fetch the total number of employees in the White House:

{% include tryit.html domain='open.whitehouse.gov' path='/resource/9j92-xfdk.json' args="$select=count(salary)" %}

It can also be used in `$group` aggregations, like this one to get the count of employees by job type:

{% include tryit.html domain='open.whitehouse.gov' path='/resource/9j92-xfdk.json' args="$select=position_title,count(salary)&$group=position_title" %}
