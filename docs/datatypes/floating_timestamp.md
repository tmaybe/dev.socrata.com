Floating timestamps represent an instant in time with millisecond precision, with no timezone value, encoded as [ISO8601 Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Times) with no timezone offset. For example:

{% highlight javascript %}
[ {
  "date_time_column": "2014-10-13T00:00:00.000"
} ]
{% endhighlight %}

Datasets will either specify what timezone they should be interpreted in, or you can usually assume they're in the timezone of the publisher. For example, a dataset published by the [City of Chicago](http://data.cityofchicago.org) will be published in Central Standard Time.

The following operators can be used to compare and manipulate `floating_timestamp` fields: 

| Operation | Description                                                                       |
| ---       | ---                                                                               |
| `<`       | `TRUE` when the first date is earlier than the second date                        |
| `<=`      | `TRUE` when the first date is earlier than or at the same time as the second date |
| `>`       | `TRUE` when the first date is after the second date                               |
| `>=`      | `TRUE` when the first date is after or at the same time as the second date        |
| `!=`      | `TRUE` when two dates are not at the same time                                    |
| `=`       | `TRUE` when two dates are at the same time                                        |

And the following functions can be used to filter and manipulate them: 

{% include function_listing.html datatype="floating_timestamp" %}

For example, to get all of the crimes that occurred between noon and 2PM on January 10th, 2015 in Chicago:

{% include tryit.html domain='data.cityofchicago.org' path='/resource/6zsd-86xi.json' args="$where=date between '2015-01-10T12:00:00' and '2015-01-10T14:00:00'" %}

Text strings will be automatically be cast when used in comparisons, as shown above.
