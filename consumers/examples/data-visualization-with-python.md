A number of questions have come up recently about how to use the [Socrata API](http://dev.socrata.com) with [Python](http://www.python.org), an awesome programming language frequently used for data analysis. It also is the language of choice for a couple of libraries I've been meaning to check out - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/).

No, not the [endangered species that has bamboo-munched its way into our hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda) and the [Japanese lens blur that makes portraits so beautiful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh), the [Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and the [Bokeh visualization tool](http://bokeh.pydata.org/). Together, they represent an powerful set of tools that make it easy to retrieve, analyze, and visualize open data.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>First, <em>a caveat</em>. I'm not a Python developer by trade, and it's not unlikely I'll mess something up along the way. If you find something I've done wrong, feel free to <a href="http://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/issues/new">file an issue with a suggestion</a> or <a href="/contributing.html">submit a pull request</a> and we'll be glad to accept it.</p>
  <p>This script is based on the excellent <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/docs/gallery/unemployment.html">unemployment data example</a> provided with Bokeh.</p>
</div>

First, you'll need to install a few Python packages with `pip`:
    
    pip install pandas
    pip install bokeh

We're going to be analyzing this dataset of [Los Angeles Police Department Calls for Service](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/LAPD-Calls-for-Service-YTD-2014/mgue-vbsx). For fun, let's analyze the dataset and see what days of the week the most noise disturbance calls for "Parties" are on, and see if we can identify some popular holidays.

First, we'll structure a query that uses [SoQL](/docs/queries.html) to aggregate the dataset so that we don't need to pull down all of the details of the millions of calls the LAPD has received. We'll do a few things:

- Filter the dataset by `call_type_code` "507P", the code for a noise violation call on a party
- Aggregate by the truncated version of the `dispatch_date` field and get the count of noise violations per day
- Order the results by our truncated date value

{% include tryit.html domain='data.lacity.org' path='/resource/mgue-vbsx.json' args="$group=date&call_type_code=507P&$select=date_trunc_ymd(dispatch_date)%20AS%20date%2C%20count(*)&$order=date" %}

Pandas makes it super easy to read data from a JSON API, so we can just read our data directly using the `read_json` function:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import datetime
import urllib
 
from bokeh.plotting import *
from bokeh.objects import HoverTool
from collections import OrderedDict
 
# Read in our data. We've aggregated it by date already, so we don't need to worry about paging
query = ("https://data.lacity.org/resource/mgue-vbsx.json?"
    "$group=date"
    "&call_type_code=507P"
    "&$select=date_trunc_ymd(dispatch_date)%20AS%20date%2C%20count(*)"
    "&$order=date")
raw_data = pd.read_json(query)
{% endhighlight %}

Next we augment our data with a `day_of_week` index so we can then create a pivot table to build up a grid of our weekly data. We'll also create our `weeks` and `days` range and domain arrays:

{% highlight python %}
# Augment the data frame with the day of the week and the start of the week that it's in.
# This will make more sense soon...
raw_data['day_of_week'] = [date.dayofweek for date in raw_data["date"]]
raw_data['week'] = [(date - datetime.timedelta(days=date.dayofweek)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") for date in raw_data["date"]]
 
# Pivot our data to get the matrix we need
data = raw_data.pivot(index='week', columns='day_of_week', values='count')
data = data.fillna(value=0)
 
# Get our "weeks" and "days"
weeks = list(data.index)
days = ["Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
{% endhighlight %}

Now we'll format the data for Bokeh, creating parallel arrays of our axis values and our data values. We'll also create an array of color values based the number of parties for that day:

{% highlight python %}
# Set up the data for plotting. We will need to have values for every
# pair of year/month names. Map the rate to a color.
max_count = raw_data["count"].max()
day_of_week = []
week = []
color = []
parties = []
for w in weeks:
    for idx, day in enumerate(days):
        day_of_week.append(day)
        week.append(w)
        count = data.loc[w][idx]
        parties.append(count)
        color.append("#%02x%02x%02x" % (255, 255 - (count / max_count) * 255.0, 255 - (count / max_count) * 255.0))
 
source = ColumnDataSource(
    data=dict(
        day_of_week=day_of_week,
        week=week,
        color=color,
        parties=parties,
    )
)
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we'll pass everything to the Bokeh `rect` plot, which will create our visualization. We'll provide it our source data, X and Y ranges, and some plot configuration details:

{% highlight python %}
output_file('all-las-parties.html')
 
figure()
 
rect("week", "day_of_week", 1, 1, source=source,
     x_range=weeks, y_range=list(reversed(days)),
     x_axis_location="above",
     color="color", line_color=None,
     tools="resize,hover,previewsave", title="\"Party\" Disturbance Calls in LA",
     plot_width=900, plot_height=400, toolbar_location="left")
 
grid().grid_line_color = None
axis().axis_line_color = None
axis().major_tick_line_color = None
axis().major_label_text_font_size = "10pt"
axis().major_label_standoff = 0
xaxis().major_label_orientation = np.pi/3
 
hover = curplot().select(dict(type=HoverTool))
hover.tooltips = OrderedDict([
    ('parties', '@parties'),
])
 
show()      # show the plot
{% endhighlight %}

When you're done, you simply run the script with Python, and it generates and opens up the visualization in your web browser. The results are pretty cool. You can clearly see that the weekends are the busiest nights for the party patrol, but you can also spot popular holidays like New Years Eve, Independence Day, and Labor Day.
